# lenovo_energy_management
I don't have the energy management tool in Linux, so I created one for myself.

## How to Run?

1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/sudipnext/lenovo_energy_management.git
```

2. Open a terminal.
Navigate to the dist folder:
```
cd lenovo_energy_management/dist
```
3. Give execution permissions to the application:
```
chmod +x conservation
```
4. Run the application:

```
./conservation
```
